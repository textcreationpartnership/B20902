            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief Account of the late Reverend Mr. <hi>FRANCIS CROW,</hi> Author of the enſuing Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>IT has been a Custom (I cannot ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Laudable or Ancient) to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Poſterity</hi> ſome Account of the Lives of ſuch perſons as have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Good.</hi> Our Piety towards our deceaſed Friends ought not to terminate at their <hi>Graves.</hi> How fond are we even of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of thoſe who either by reaſon of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance to us, or their invulgar merit, claim a large ſhare in our Esteem and Affections? Alas, theſe can but faintly repreſent the Lineaments of their outward Vizage; but <hi>Biography</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their better and more noble parts. Many of the <hi>Hero</hi>'s of Antiquity had been bury din <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,</hi> as well as covered with Dust, were we not beholding to the Pen of a <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or a <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> who (by letting us know what in them was worthy of our <hi>imitation</hi>) have reſcu'd their Memories from <hi>Oblivion,</hi> and crown'd their Names with <hi>Immortality.</hi> It is the priviledge of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> that they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204825:4"/>ſhall be had in <hi>everlaſting Remembrance.</hi> And ſuch a one, I think, I may venture to call Mr <hi>Crow;</hi> For if a holy exemplary Life, and a no leſs Pious and Inſtructing Concluſion of it, can (juſtly) confer that Character upon any Man, certainly it was his due.</p>
            <p>It was not my happineſs to be acquainted with him in his Adoleſcency, the paucity of my own years prohibited that; therefore this brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what I obſerv'd of that bleſſed man has its Scene laid much later, and only comprehends a ſhort Tract of Time. But in that (as in a curious piece of <hi>Miniature</hi>) we have (in ſome meaſure) a proſpect of the reſt. I ſhall conſider him in two Capacities, as a <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel,</hi> and as a <hi>private Chriſtian;</hi> In both which reſpects his Eminency was conſpicuous to all judicious and obſerving Spectators, that either ſate under his Miniſtry, or were admitted to any Intimacy of Acquaintance with him. As for thoſe Gifts and Abilities that were more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately requiſite to qualifie him for his Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Important <hi>Function,</hi> they were ſuch, and ſo many, as very rarely unite and center in any one Man; His Judgment was great, his Fancy rich, his Memory retentive, and his Elocution correſpondent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> are the Two <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles</hi> (not to ſay <hi>Eyes</hi>) of a <hi>Divine;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Holy Scriptures were written originally
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204825:4"/>in thoſe Cryptick Languages. And in both of theſe his skill was ſuch as others may ſooner <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> than <hi>imitate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I my ſelf have ſeen amongst his <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</hi> (which were full as excellent as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) a judicious Collection of moſt of the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies, or Derivations of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words us'd in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> A work of great <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Uſefulneſs,</hi> especially to ſuch as labour in the <hi>Lord's Vineyard.</hi> Nor was he meanly vers'd in the copious Delicacies of the Noble <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. It was one of his <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Recreations</hi> (as indeed I knew of none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that he us'd) to propound Queſtions to young Scholars that came to viſit him, concerning the meaning of ſome difficult <hi>Greek</hi> words, and after they had given their ſenſe of them, he would (with a grave ſweetneſs peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) charm their Ears with a Learned Diſcourſe of the Depths, and Myſteries that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in them. Indeed, I know but few that may be reckon'd his <hi>Equals</hi> in <hi>Sacred Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His preaching,<note place="margin">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204825:5"/>tendency than a barren unimprovable Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on], but what he deliver'd was both ſerious and ſolid, weighty Matter coucht in apt Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>For he did not ſtudiouſly affect a lofty unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible <hi>Jargon,</hi> which ſome Men are apt to miſcall <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> But only conform'd himſelf to ſuch a modeſt decency of Stile, as was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to preſerve him from the contempt of thoſe who (principally] regard the <hi>Form</hi> (not the <hi>Subſtance</hi>) of a <hi>Sermon.</hi> And no wonder if ſuch a Miniſtry had its <hi>Seals.</hi> I ſuppoſe many a poor Soul, in and about <hi>Clare,</hi> may (upon his account) uſe the Language of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> upon his going to <hi>Millain</hi> to hear <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> preach; I come not to him as to an Inſtructor;<note place="margin">Non ad illum ut ad Doctorem veni, per te en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Catechiſing of Children</hi> (and ſome of <hi>Riper Years</hi>) was ſo well intended, and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204825:5"/>proſecuted by him, that, tho I ſhould be ſilent, many of thoſe who have been educated at the Feet of this ſo great a Doctor of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> are yet alive to trumpet forth his praiſe. And his Memory will even for this be pretious to ſucceeding Generations.</p>
            <p>But hitherto I have ſpoken of him as an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as a Workman that needed not be aſhamed: And tho much more might be truly ſaid of him as ſuch, yet it no ways comporting with my preſent Deſign, I ſhall wave that, and deſcend to the other part of his <hi>Character,</hi> which is to conſider him as a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I make any progreſs in that, I judge it convenient (in two or three Lines to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> were exactly <hi>parallel;</hi> and what was ſaid of <hi>Origen</hi> may (with no leſs reaſon) be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to him; As he liv'd,<note place="margin">Quemadmodum vixit, ſic docuit, &amp; quemadmodum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, ſic vixit.</note> ſo he taught; and as he taught, ſo he liv'd.</p>

               <p>Chriſt hath appointed their conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repreſentations to be in the eye of the Church, in their manner and meaſure to ſupply the room of his bodily preſence, while he is in heaven. The table in the tabernacle <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.23, 24. May repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this Table of the Lord, overlaid with pure gold, and a crown of Gold round about it becauſe of Holineſs becoming it, and a King ſitting at it. At this table ſhould we be asking our own Souls, what our thoughts are of Chriſt, and what we have for him, that it may be no idle viſit you make, or fruitleſs view you take of him; but let your requeſts and great ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be ready on the ſtring for more grace to your ſelves, or true grace to your Relations; what is upon your hearts for your Soul, child, yoke-fellow or ſon, the Church of God?</p>
               <p>Make ſure you have grace before you come, if you can: I ſay if you can, for every worthy communicant cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs himſelf certain of his ſincerity: but ſo far as he can diſcern, by obſerving of his own heart, he is truely willing to have Chriſt and his benefits on the terms that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204825:12"/>they are offered: <hi>i. e.</hi> To take Chriſt in all his offices as King to rule him, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to teach him, and as Prieſt to pardon and ſave him.</p>
               <p>And next we muſt be careful to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe grace given. They who have no grace can act none, and therefore muſtly by and ſit idle here, gazing on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Chriſt And if any be here who know themſelves to be ungodly ones; I think they had beſt riſe and run from their own damnation. Some feed without fear, or remorſe for ſin; yea perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to keep up ſome luſt they know of. To what end is this ordinance for you? It's a day of Darkneſs, and no Light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great voice of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is, Behold me, Behold me. We are called here to look on a pierced Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And what ſhall we ſee in him? See the maker of all things bowed down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of our ſins, and weight of Gods wrath. Look on him whom you have pierced and mourn, Look on his wounds and weep. Look on his Love and wonder. Look on his ſatisfactions and Believe. Look on his Victory and rejoyce. Look on his purchaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn your earthly intereſts. Here is the beſt and brighteſt glaſs in all the world God gives us to behold his ſon in, and we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204825:13"/>may come as near him here as any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance can bring us.</p>
               <p>When you look on the Elements, ſtay not there, till you aſcend, and ſee him who is inviſible. When by faith you come to ſee him whom your Soul loveth, proſtrate thy ſinfull Soul, with a holy wondering, that ſinfull duſt and aſhes may draw ſo near. Study to get the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eye on him, as loath to take it off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo well pleaſed with his beauty and worth. Learn to think the leſs of other objects after you have ſeen the Lord. As <hi>Mahometans</hi> put out their eyes ſome of them, after they have beheld <hi>Mahomets</hi> tomb, that they may never defile their eyes with an other ſight after ſo goodly and glorious a one.</p>
               <p>The name of the Lord being ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently engraven on all we are about, ſhould ſtrike a dread and holy reverence on all our hearts the day, the table, the ſupper we are at, are all the Lords; but what if we be not the people of the Lord? truly, if we be not, he bids us not wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: and what if we be here and the Lord not with us? Then we had far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be elſe where. But how may we know, if we have him preſent, even his ſweet ſociety and bleſſed company? It's

               <p n="3">3. O the great condeſcention of God to ſinful mortals that when he was inviſible, by reaſon of that infinite diſtance between the divine nature and ours, he made himſelf to be ſeen in the fleſh; and now by his aſcention, having made his fleſh alſo inviſible, by reaſon of the vaſt diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance between his place and ours, he hath made his fleſh in a myſtical ſence, even to be ſeen and taſted in the ſacrament. O if
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204825:14"/>he hath humbled himſelf thus far unto our ſenſes, let us not by an odious ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude humble him lower, even under our feet and trample on this precious blood of the Covenant, by ruſhing on this ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ſacred a thing with a careleſs and unprepared frame, taking no pains to get a broken and holy heart to intertain him with.</p>
               <p>To take this ſacrament into an earthly dirty heart, is to take this heavenly bread, and throw it into the dirt. O do's any of you think to come hither, and take theſe holy myſteries into your covetous, proud, luſtful unrenewed hearts? It's plainly to reſolve upon laying up his richeſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in a noiſom Sink; and what an indignity is this? Chriſt is in heaven himſelf, and will not enter into any but an heavenly heart here. And he who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf ſo much to the view of your ſenſes, calleth you to Spiritualiſe your earthly ſenſes: let that mouth that cateth at this table, never ſpeak vanity nor lies: that hand which is reached out to receive him, be no more a right hand of falſhood or injury to any: theſe eyes which look on your Lord here be no more gazing on Vanity or forbidden objects.</p>
               <p>But to raiſe your hearts above beggarly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204825:14"/>Elements which you ſee this day with eyes of fleſh; conſider this ordinance ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies and ſeales Chriſt and his Covenant, with all his rich promiſes of grace and glory. The body of our bleſed Lord is really in heaven, for he is riſen and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended; but his body is as truely ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally here, as really in heaven, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt clear repreſentation of his death and ſolemn commemoration of it that the earth bears, or we are capable of in the fleſh. If there had been a more proper and better way, we are bound to believe, our Lord would have left it with us. And ſince this is a token left with us to remember us of his deareſt love in dying for us and waſhing us in his own blood, let us receive and celebrate it with the livelieſt affections and the heartieſt acceptation we are capable of. Still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with our ſelves, that tho' it be good to be here, where much more of Chriſt is to be ſeen to day, than many places of the earth can afford; yet, that it's far better to be in heaven, where the vail of our mortality ſhall be rent, and the vail of this infirm fleſh of ours ſhall be made ſpiritual and glorious, the ſhadows of Sacraments fly away, and the glaſs of all Goſpel ordinances be removed as uſeleſs,

               <p>Now the hope and aſſurance of all this we come to ſeal. Trifle not with ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a thing, but ſet your heart to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of your Lord here with all his ſanctifying, quickning and comforting vertue, which our ſinful ſinking ſouls need ſo much.

               <p>O let not weakneſs ſo much deterr, as wants drive us hither: for ſenſe of wants and weakneſs, and unworthineſs and wrath, all fit for him, who hath all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtrength, worth and merit; and who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204825:15"/>bare the wrath of God for them that flee to him for refuge. And think it not enough to make your appearance here without ſome fitneſs for ſo ſolemn an action. It is not ſo incongruous to ſport and laugh at your Father's Funeral, as to ſit here reſtleſs and unconcerned at the commemoration of our bleſſed Lords death, yea bloody death and bitter paſſion. Shall we ſee the head wounded here, and the members have no feeling? That we ſee the bread broken which repreſents the breaking of Chriſts precious body for us, and have no broken hearts? Yea, ſhall we be called to Contemplate the wrath of his provoked Father, pour'd into his Cup, and drinking the dregs thereof, and crying out under the weight of our Sins, which brake the very rock of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made the Stones of the Temple to rend in ſunder? Was his Body broken to let out his Blood? And ſhall not our Souls be broken to let in?</p>
               <p>☞ Look well to three things, if you would be worthy Communicants, <hi>viz.</hi> To have Grace ere you come to exerciſe Grace here, and to increaſe it by coming. Now for you that have Grace, but it runs low, and is not lively, as you would have it, to entertain your Lord withal: Know there is ſmoaking
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204825:16"/>Grace as well as flaming Grace; and Chriſt will not quench the ſmoaking flax: and what if he ſuffer thy Graces to keep low to day, that thy Heart may be lowly for it?</p>
               <p>☞ But for them that are at high water, and Spring-tide, let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall. Senſible Enjoyments are but ſlippery things here; Man in his beſt eſtate in this Life is altogether vanity: but while the Lord allows them on us, let us be careful to improve them well</p>
               <p>☞ But what if all within lies ſtill, and an heavy heart ſtir not yet for all that is ſaid? Then look unto him that can remove Mountains, and raiſe the dead. The warm breathings of Heaven muſt be fetch'd in by believing Prayer, <hi>Song</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> And when thou haſt called on thy Soul to awake and work, and yet nothing within thy rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul will obey, then call on him whom Seas and Winds obey. When we cannot fetch Life into our dead Souls, then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Prince of Life quickens whom he will.</p>
               <p n="5">☞ 5. A ſight of ſin, and a ſight of Chriſt who ſuffer'd for it, are our fitteſt Objects at ſuch a time; and in the ſufferings of Chriſt we ſee moſt of ſin's evil. The death of all the creatures under the Law for man's ſin, was nothing to the death of Chriſt for it. As
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204825:16"/>God looks on Believers through a dying Chriſt, and loves them, ſo let us look on ſin through a dying Chriſt, and hate it.</p>
               <p>Thy ſin is indeed the Object of God's hatred; but thy miſery that comes by it will God pity, and ſo pardon ſin, and ſhew thee mercy, if thou canſt hate thy ſin; and in token of thy hatred of it, flee far from it, and cry to God mightily for grace and ſtrength againſt it.</p>
               <p>And if a poor ſoul hath been labouring laſt night and this morning for a more humbling ſight of ſin, than yet hath been granted him, he muſt never think to ſee ſin ſo exceeding ſinful, as in ſeeing Chriſt a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin; and if it had not been for our ſin, all the other enemies would never have ſlain the Lord of Glory. And when the worſt of ſin is in Chriſt's ſufferings for it, we muſt not only make uſe of Chriſt as a Glaſs to ſee ſin in, but as a Phyſician too to cure it. And when he hath ſhewed us our ſin, we muſt not go to King <hi>Jareb</hi> with our wounds; but the ſame hand which broke us muſt bind us up. And be your ſins what they will, if you can penitently and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly plead pardon, in the mediation of a broken Redeemer, there will be found Balm enough to cure, and Blood enough to waſh, yea drown them all in the depths
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204825:17"/>of divine mercy; tho we muſt not <hi>ſin that grace may abound,</hi> and go and ſin to make work for the Blood of Chriſt, and go about prophanely to poſe his mercy; for tho the Blood of Chriſt for fulneſs and efficacy be a Sea, yet for tenderneſs it's a Sea of Glaſs, and mingled with fire to burn up our Luſts. We come either to God as a Phyſician or a Judge: for either we bring Souls full of ſores to be cured, or full of ſins to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>To meet with Chriſt and not to part with ſin is ſad and dreadful: as Chriſt came into the world to deſtroy ſin, ſo ſhould we come now to Chriſt for the ſame end. O the ſin of our natures, that old man, the ill habits, the ſtrong luſts, the ill haunts our hearts have got; venture to ſet Chriſt againſt them all to day. We cannot ſpeak good of Chriſt but ill of ſin too. How ſad to ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of ſin obeyed, and the commands of Chriſt ſlighted? and yet theſe are the moſt common ſights we ſee on earth. O! what pride, ſelf conceit, paſſion, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, revenge, wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

We hide and ſmother ſins deformity and damnableneſs under the mask of pleaſing and pitying our ſelves.

               <p>Be not affraid of hurting your ſelf by parting with ſin no, no; could we fall upon our ſins and cutt them off, O what free lives might we live? what noble Lords and brave conquerours were we? And for their ſtrength fear it not. Go
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:204825:18"/>forth againſt them in the faith of this Lord you ſee crucified for them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites you to partake of the life purchaſed by the death this ordinance calls us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. It ill becomes us to complain of the ſtrength of this enemy that Chriſt hath overcome. All ſin's ſtrength conſiſts in our cowardice. Fight and ye ſhall overcome, conquer and ye ſhall be crowned.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we eat of the ſacrifice, let us have faith that we may partake of the Altar and have Chriſt in it. We may ſay to you in this ſacrament as <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in the other, <hi>if thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt, Act.</hi> 8.37. At all times we have need of faith, for we muſt live and walk by faith; but in no ſtep more need than in this: <hi>John.</hi> 6.56. We cannot eat his fleſh unleſs we dwell in him; now Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. Faith is the eye to diſcern the Lords body here, the hand to receive him, the mouth to feed on him. We do neither ſee, receive, nor feed here without Faith.</p>
               <p>Now it's an eaſier matter to look with a bodily eye on bread and wine, than to behold the ſlain lamb of God bruiſed for us. The world think it eaſy to believe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204825:18"/>who never had a true ſight of their ſins, nor ſenſe of Gods wrath, nor were ever ſifted or ſhaken by Satans temptations, nor troubled with terrours of Conſcience, nor acquainted with natural weakneſs, and Chriſtian infirmities, and our own inſufficiency for ſo much as a right or good thought of God. Is it eaſy for a proud heart to deny it ſelf in the point of ſalvation? And wholly to take a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs from Chriſt, heartily ſubmitting to a Goſpel ſalvation in ſaith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Is it eaſy to ſee Chriſts humiliation and look for exaltation out of it? and to look for pleaſure by his pain, Riches by his poverty, ſtrength by his weakneſs, and life by his death, and a bleſſing by his curſe.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of baſtard faith is eaſy to come by, you'll find every where too much of it; but the Faith of Gods elect, peculiar to them, even the ſpirit of Faith, which purifieth the heart, and worketh by love, and maketh the ſoul live, is not ſo common.</p>
               <p>Now 1. this faith is never without heart humiliation for ſin, even a looking on him whom we have pierced, with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſenſe of the diſhonour and wounding of him by our Rebellions and Unbelief.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204825:19"/>O! here the ſoul ſees its baſeneſs, and weeps that ſo bleſſed a Redeemer ſhould bleed for the ſins of ſuch a wretch and be ſtill ſo inſenſible of this love.</p>

And it wonders at the glorious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of love that it ſhould chuſe ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and this even confounds a ſinful ſoul, and makes it with a holy ſhame lye down in the duſt and open its mouth no more. <hi>Ezek</hi> 16.63.</p>

Now whoſoever comes hither ſhort of this, at beſt the ſeal is but ſet to a blanck, and ſo ſtands them in no ſtead; for they receive not Chriſt and carry none of his benefits with them: yea it's well if it ſeal not their damnation. And I'm like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affraid of another ſort that may come hither, who formerly might have covenanted with Chriſt; but for want of a lively and well exerciſed faith grow blind and ſee not aſtar off, and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that they were purged from their old ſins; and ſo turn formal and cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And readily ſuch Conſuetudinaries who follow the drove can give little other account of their coming, but that it's the way other good people go in, and it they ſhould not come, they might be miſſed by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:204825:20"/>good neighbours; and how could they keep up a name to live, if they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of good company? It's to be feared many ſuch things are with us. But if ſo, ſuch may eat and drink Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themſelves, temporal Judgments in ſtead of ſpiritual enemies. For ſuch things many were weak, ſome ſick and others fallen aſleep in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. And if ſuch belong to God he will find out the way to awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them and not let them ſleep the ſleep of death, but will ſhew them wherein they have exceeded and a wake them to their work, out of this Lethargy, either by renewing ſome terrrors of Conſcience, or turning his hand upon them by ſome torturing tribulation. And there is a third ſort I fear may come who are almoſt well reſolved never to come up to the terms of having Chriſt, becauſe of ſome belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luſt they are ſo loath to part with: and go away with the young man in the Goſpel, ſad, from every diſcovering or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, whereby he finds all muſt be left to follow Chriſt if he have treaſure in heaven; which his hypocritical heart could never yet comply with; and ſo finds no ſweetneſs in ſacraments nor Sermons, nor never can in this condition, for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204825:20"/>conſolations of God are ſmall becauſe of ſome ſecret thing with him. <hi>Job</hi> 15.11.

               <p n="8">8. Such a day will either be one of our beſt or worſt days. It will either further ſalvation and bring you nearer God, or harden your hearts and heighten your Judgment. A hot ſummers day ripens the corn, ſo do theſe ſeaſons of grace ripen faſter than any thing can for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when not improved but abuſed. Would it not be ſad that any of us ſhould be worſe at laſt, than if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been here, nor ſeen the Lord in theſe precious ordinances?

So that the beſt way to examine this matter is by a due conſideration of the nature and uſe of this ordinance. Here is bread, that calls for hunger: and wine for thirſt, and both for ſtrength and refreſhing. Here is bread broken, and wine poured out, which calls for a broken heart and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of our ſouls to him whom we pierced and put to pain. Here's conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bread and Wine, come as Conſecrated Perſons to Conſecrated Elements. Here is a Feaſt, then come as confederated Friends to take a fill. Here is a Seal of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (call'd the Cup of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Blood) come and take a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And as it's full of Myſteries it calls us to come with a Piercing Eye to diſcern the Lord's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ody, and its worth, under the meanneſs of outward Signs.</p>
               <p>Now you ſee, to come unſuitably, is to come unworthily. And may we not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think on the doom of that Gueſt that came in without the Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and that it is not one or a few that come ſo, but very many, appears from <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.11. and 1. v. compared.

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:204825:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>The King took no exceptions againſt his gueſts when he came to view them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of being poor, halt, or weak but offended with them that refuſed to come and with them who came without the wedding garment. Many refuſe to come, that are utterly careleſs to be in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to meet Chriſt in this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and make nothing of a life time of refuſing an offered Chriſt therein. For which ſo groſs a contempt of his grace how ſhall many anſwer? And others come without the wedding garment, and with theſe he is angry, intimating that many weakneſſes he could paſs by, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we make conſcience of preparation and putting on the wedding garment, which I take to be a good ſtate in Chriſt through his righteouſneſs imputed; and a ſpiritual frame; lamps trimmed and in good faſhion for feaſting with Chriſt, minds ſpiritual and graces active, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, hope and love in exerciſe.</p>
